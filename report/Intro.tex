\section{Introduction and Project Goal}

This project investigates the relationship between demographic factors such as highest education level, age, gender, and ethnicity with employment status and salary in South Africa. 
Using real-world 2023 household survey data found through stats SA's interactive data portal: `Nesstar'~\cite{StatsSA_GHS2023}, his investigation aims to conduct statistical hypothesis testing to ascertain whether these factors significantly influence employment outcomes and salary levels in the contemporary South African context. 
Additionally, clustering techniques will be employed to uncover underlying patterns within the dataset.

The dataset comprises 112 variables, providing a comprehensive overview of household statistics within the South African population. However, for this analysis, we will focus on several key variables that are particularly relevant to our research objectives:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Education level}
    \item \textbf{Employment status}
    \item \textbf{Salary}
    \item \textbf{Age}
    \item \textbf{Gender}
    \item \textbf{Ethnicity}
\end{itemize}
